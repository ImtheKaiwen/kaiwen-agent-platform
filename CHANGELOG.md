# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Add deterministic lifecycle, central policy, bounded context, short-term and
  policy-gated long-term memory foundations.
- Add background jobs over the existing Task Runtime, bounded subagent delegation,
  trigger routing, objectives, watches, and attention evaluation.
- Add policy-gated model routing, atomic hierarchical budgets, immutable prompt and
  skill registries, artifacts, and capability manifests.
- Add evaluation, observation-only replay, redacted dead letters, backpressure,
  health, server-side secret providers, distributed leases, and tenant-scoped
  metrics.
- Add optional PostgreSQL/pgvector memory and Redis coordination adapters.
- Add a compatibility-preserving, single-agent-first `AgentRuntime` with explicit
  chat/action modes, independent autonomy levels, trusted identity propagation, and
  deny-by-default tool exposure.
- Add immutable agent definitions and workspace profiles, a provider factory registry,
  fail-fast composition validation, and exact runtime configuration pins.
- Add optional bounded runtime context composition, provider-aware token counters,
  provenance-checked rolling compaction, and owner-scoped tool-output offloading.
- Add versioned standards packs, deterministic requirement resolution, host verifier
  registration, evidence-backed completion gates, and bounded repair tracking.
- Add owner-scoped durable workflow records with immutable configuration pins,
  restart-safe action intents, one-time approvals, SQLite idempotency receipts, safe
  lifecycle controls, and lease-guarded uncertain-action recovery.
- Add validated single-agent workflow plans compiled into the existing Task Runtime,
  with owner isolation, evidence-backed completion, and finite repair/replan control.
- Add optional versioned team composition over the existing delegation and job
  runtime, with least-privilege member selection and bounded structured handoffs.
- Add technical model capability records, fail-closed data-locality routing, and
  optional Gemini/Ollama adapters with centrally executed tool proposals.
- Add provider-neutral speech recognition, synthesis, transcript, and ephemeral
  pipeline contracts with explicit audio-processing permission and deterministic fakes.
- Add bounded workspace filesystem tools and trusted MCP tool bindings that preserve
  central permissions, approvals, side-effect classification, and execution policy.
- Add credential-free runtime and speech quickstarts that execute in CI.
- Redact canonical durable event payloads at validation and built-in persistence or
  streaming boundaries, with an MCP toolset-escalation injection regression.
- Add a deterministic concurrent-run regression proving provider continuation state
  remains local to each agent run.
- Add backward-compatible event owner fields and exact tenant/user/session scoped
  reads, including a fail-closed SQLite migration for historical unowned events.
- Add policy-approved initial-call model failover with locality revalidation, explicit
  transient-error classification, and strict provider continuation affinity.
- Add CI-verified, credential-free autonomous workflow and least-privilege team
  quickstarts.
- Add a concurrent multitenant regression for exact event visibility, action-intent
  identity, and restart-safe receipt replay under deliberately colliding client IDs.
- Add a real subprocess-boundary checkpoint recovery regression and installed-wheel
  consumer validations for an isolated Todo workflow and a policy-bounded fictional
  legal domain.
- Require formatter checks and the isolated consumer validations in CI and release
  verification.

## 0.4.0a1 — 2026-09-24

- Add provider-neutral inbound phone-call contracts and retry-safe webhook decision
  deduplication.
- Add the OpenAI Live direct-SIP accept, reject, transfer, and hangup adapter.
- Add a Twilio outbound PSTN-to-SIP adapter with TLS/SRTP-ready SIP targets and
  allowlisted custom SIP binding headers.
- Convert accepted SIP calls into normal phone-channel realtime session records so
  existing sideband tools, permissions, approvals, idempotency, and audit can be reused.
- Parse only already-verified `live.transport.incoming` events and keep SIP headers as
  untrusted metadata.
- Normalize received DTMF digits without treating them as client commands.

## 0.3.0a1 — 2026-09-18

- Add trusted OpenAI Live sideband attachment for existing browser WebRTC sessions.
- Register strict Responses-delegation tool schemas when creating Live sessions.
- Execute completed delegated function calls through the existing permission,
  approval, idempotency, retry, and audit pipeline.
- Bind sideband tool execution to the logical realtime session, tenant, and user.
- Keep sideband shutdown independent from primary WebRTC/SIP media and reject
  duplicate completed response events.

## 0.2.0a1 — 2026-09-18

- Add the provider-neutral Realtime Core with isolated session lifecycle,
  interruption/reconnect handling, and layered concurrency limits.
- Add the OpenAI Live primary WebSocket adapter and server-authorized WebRTC session
  bootstrap without exposing API credentials to clients.
- Add normalized audio, transcript, usage, error, and nested Responses events.
- Add tenant-scoped durable conversations that unify text and voice transcripts while
  keeping raw audio ephemeral.
- Add allowlisted background task submission and tenant/user-scoped task status.
- Extend `AgentContext` and `AgentTask` with optional tenant, user, client, and
  conversation identity fields.
- Add SQLite conversation persistence, fake transports, integration tests, and
  reusable Realtime/Live documentation.

## 0.1.0a2 — 2026-09-17

- Fix multi-step OpenAI tool execution when `store=False`.
- Carry provider-owned continuation state inside a single agent run without sharing
  conversation state between sessions.
- Preserve encrypted reasoning items for stateless Responses API continuation.
- Expand the OpenAI smoke example to verify a real two-turn tool call.

## 0.1.0a1 — 2026-09-17

- Initial alpha release of the Python runtime and OpenAI adapter.
- Initial npm releases of the shared protocol and headless UI runtime.
