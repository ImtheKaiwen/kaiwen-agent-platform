# Persistence and event delivery

## Ports

The core exposes four independent persistence boundaries:

- `SessionStore` for application session metadata.
- `RunStore` for lifecycle and completion state.
- `EventStore` for ordered replayable runtime events.
- `AuditStore` for security-relevant execution records.

Applications may use one adapter for all four boundaries or compose separate stores.
The core does not require SQLAlchemy, a web framework, or a specific database.

`AgentEvent` can carry trusted `tenant_id` and `user_id` ownership alongside its
session ID. External/user-facing readers should depend on `ScopedEventStore` and call
`list_events_scoped(EventScope(...))`, which requires an exact tenant, user, and
session match. The original `list_events(session_id=...)` method remains available
for backward-compatible trusted internal replay and must not be exposed directly as
an authorization boundary.

Durable workflow composition adds three separate boundaries: `RuntimeRunStore` for
owner-scoped run state and immutable version pins, `ActionIntentStore` for external
side-effect state and receipts, and `DurableApprovalStore` for one-time decisions.
These records are intentionally separate from conversations and the compact legacy
`AgentRun` model.

## SQLite reference adapter

`SQLitePersistence` implements all four boundaries using the Python standard library.
It enables WAL mode, uses a monotonically increasing event sequence, and opens a
short-lived connection for each async operation through `asyncio.to_thread`.

```python
from kaiwen_agent.persistence import SQLitePersistence

persistence = SQLitePersistence("runtime/agent.sqlite3")
agent = Agent(
    name="example",
    model=provider,
    event_sink=persistence,
    run_store=persistence,
)
```

SQLite is the reference and local-development adapter. Multi-instance deployments
should implement the same ports with PostgreSQL or another transactional store.

Existing SQLite event tables gain nullable ownership columns in place. Historical
rows are not assigned guessed owners: they remain readable through the legacy trusted
API but fail closed and are invisible through scoped reads. New agent, task, job,
policy, artifact, objective, watch, trigger, and attention events propagate trusted
owner identity when their source context has it.

`SQLitePersistence` also implements the durable workflow stores. The standalone
`SQLiteIdempotencyStore` persists the existing tool receipt contract and may share
the same database file. A durable tool execution supplies both stores explicitly:

```python
from kaiwen_agent.persistence import SQLiteIdempotencyStore, SQLitePersistence
from kaiwen_agent.tools import DurableApprovalGate, ToolExecutor

state = SQLitePersistence("runtime/agent.sqlite3")
executor = ToolExecutor(
    approval_gate=DurableApprovalGate(state),
    action_intent_store=state,
    idempotency_store=SQLiteIdempotencyStore("runtime/agent.sqlite3"),
)
```

Pending approvals and prepared actions survive restart. A process interruption while
the handler may already have produced an external effect is not treated as a normal
retry: `RuntimeRecoveryManager` marks the intent uncertain and blocks the run for
provider reconciliation or human review. Recovery must hold an injected `LeaseStore`;
multi-host deployments must use a distributed implementation and enforce fencing at
the protected write boundary. This is at-least-once execution, not exactly-once.

## SSE

`SSEEventBroker` can persist an event to another sink and fan it out to active
session subscribers. It yields framework-neutral SSE strings, so FastAPI, Starlette,
or another HTTP adapter can wrap the stream without entering the core package.

## Audit redaction

`RedactingAuditStore` recursively removes credential-like keys and common API key or
Bearer token values before forwarding a record. Product applications should still
avoid adding unnecessary personal or secret data to audit details.
